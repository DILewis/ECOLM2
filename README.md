# An Electronic Corpus of Lute Music (ECOLM)
This repository will contain data and code arising from the ECOLM 2 project (2002-6)

The first batch of contents is the complete raw database dump from the metadata and edition MySQL database. It is provided under a CC0 licence, though users are encouraged to credit the project.

This will be followed by a collection of the tabcode editions (they are included in the database dump but will be separated out) and the original website code (in PHP, now released under GPL3).

The work here is the result of two grants from the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (ECOLM 1 & 2) and was produced by Tim Crawford, Michael Gale and David Lewis.
